# I collaborated with [Hani Abdel Ghani](https://github.com/Hani0101) on this API. We followed the clean architecture from [this site](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-build-a-clean-architecture-web-api-with-net-core-8/?authuser=0) to complete the APIs. The steps we took: 

1) Created a solution for the Domain layer including our entities (Users.cs, Posts.cs, Notifications.cs, Comments.cs, Categories.cs, Votes.cs)
2) Created a solution for the Application layer which includes the interfaces for our entities, as well as the services.
3) Created a solution for the Infrastructure layer, applying the interfaces for our repositories.
4) Created an ASP.NET Core Web API project for our application layer. Implementing the necessary controllers and configuring the program.cs.
5) We tested our CRUD functions on swagger insuring everything works as intended.

# The following is a detailed description of what the APIs are capable of doing:

# Security Measures:
#### JWT  along with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization Libraries were implemented to generate a Token for each signed in user, and from this Token users get the privlige to use the features of some of the APIs(such as creating post, voting, commenting....)
